# Fuzzy-AOI-EyeTracking

Perform area of interest measurements on eye tracking data recorded with an Tobii X300 during a series of experiments.
The scripts in this repositry are dependant on the I2MC-filter: https://github.com/royhessels/I2MC, be sure to add them to the Matlab path.

`eyetracker_HF_UL.m` contains the options for an experiment with discrimination between houses and faces and upper and lower parts of a face.
`eyetracker_ME.m` contains the options for an experiment with discrimination between mouths and eyes.
Adjust and run any of these files to use the code.
